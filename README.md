# Code Travel California Website

In this activity, you’ll review a creative brief, and you will code a webpage for Travel Calfiornia using Boostrap 4, HTML, and CSS.

- A creative brief’s purpose is to help guide your design decisions when you receive a design from a product manager or client. A creative brief communicates how a design should look, feel, and emulate the style of the design they’re looking for. 

- As a developer, we use redlined wireframes to better understand the layout handed off to us, so we have a visual idea of how we want to go about coding up the page. When we see a design as a series of boxes, it helps us digest a task that can sometimes feel overwhelming at first glance.

## Review the Brief

TRAVEL CALIFORNIA

Hello, we are Travel California and we need a website developer to bring our vision of our new webpage to life. Our in-house designer did a pretty good job, but feel free to tweak our design if you feel like you have ideas that can make us better. 

We like:
- Strong, legible fonts.
- Clear, well-defined sections.
- Lifestyle imagery that shows off the sights and scenery of California. The imagery must be crisp and make our viewers want to explore California.

Ways you can contribute:
- Many of our sections could use extra UI elements or features. Everything looks nice, but we wouldn’t mind more ways to interact with the webpage.
- Color scheme: If you want to explore another color palette, feel free! But try to stick to the style we have laid out in the design.
- Our typography looks nice, but we are always open to other suggestions. Maybe you can add a font that feels more... adventurous? 

Your final solution should look similar to this:

## Wireframes

Your assets and wireframes have already been finished for you. Normally you would need to do this yourself. You can see the images and wireframes in the appropriate folders.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Build the HTML 

It’s time to build the structure of your webpage. 

**Notes**

- Use custom HTML and Bootstrap to start the build process.

- While you do have creative control over the end product, keep in mind that the client is looking for specific things that are detailed in the creative brief.

- Most web developers build the containers and structure of their design before they style the webpage aesthetics. Building the site structure is the hardest part of being a front-end web developer, so don’t be surprised if you struggle a bit with this step! It’s normal. Redline the designs that you are handed!

- Below, you will find some tips on how you could build this layout. These rules, however, are not set in stone, and there are multiple ways to build the website.

### Part 2: Build the CSS (Style the Webpage)

For this section you will need to sign up for the software **[Figma](https://www.figma.com)**. Figma is a powerful design software that UX designers will use to create webpages before they are coded.

Once you have signed up, follow the instructions below to access the Travel California Figma File:

1. Open the [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/xRhD5mUQHtdAImH8DUZQz8/Redline-Zeplin-Wireframe-Template?node-id=102%3A330) for Travel California.
2. Click the menu button in the top left. Select FILE > SAVE LOCAL COPY.
3. Import the file into your Figma Dashboard
4. Open the file.

The Inspect tab in Figma lets you view and copy the existing code and values for your designs. Copy single line items or entire sets of values to make the development process easier.

5. The Inspect panel can be opened from the right sidebar with a simple click on the "Inspect" tab at the top.

- Using this panel, you can easily inspect the properties of any element from your design.

6. Use Figma's Inspect panel to view and copy values for your selection.

![Figma Properties](assets/images/figma-properties.png)

  - Properties include values for an object's dimensions and constraints.
  - View the Content in a text layer.
  - View the Typography values for a text layer, including font, weight, line height, and more.
  - Use the Color section to view values in Hex, RGB, CSS, HSL, and HSB color models.
  - Copy values for an object's Shadows (inner and drop shadow) and Borders (stroke).
  - View the details of any prototyping Animation, including the trigger, action, and destination. You can also see the animation, the easing curve, and duration of the transition.
  - View CSS for your selection.
    - Be careful with these properties. You will be using CSS to do much of the positioning for you.

7. Add imagery and fonts to your website.

- The images you will need can be found in the `images` folder.
- To find custom fonts, check the Travel California Adobe Figma Inspect or visit https://fonts.google.com to select your own. 

8. Review the resources for extra help and good luck!
